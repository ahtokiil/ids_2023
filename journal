### Morphologically disambiguated corpus

1. Content

The work with the morphological disambiguation of Estonian began in the COPERNICUS-project "Multext-East" (1995-1997). During that project G. Orwell's novel "1984" was disambiguated. 
The main part of this corpus, 400 000 words, has been disambiguated during 2002-2003. This work has been supported by the national program "Eesti keel ja rahvuskultuur" 
(Estonian Language and National Culture). The following researchers have participated in this work: Külli Habicht, Heiki-Jaan Kaalep, Neeme Kahusk, Kadri Muishnek, Heili Orav, Andriela Rääbis, Kadri Vider.
