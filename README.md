# Introduction to data science - fall 2023

## Project D8 - Estonian verb forms

### Goals

1. To analyse the Estonian language corpora’s verb forms’ distribution
2. To prove or reject the hypothesis that weight of verbs in different corpora varies below statistical significance.
3. Long-term goal: to study verb distributions inside a lemma in different corpora and detect anomalies – possible change of word classes (recategorization)
