## The Balanced Corpus of Estonian

The [Balanced Corpus of Estonian](https://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/grammatikakorpus/index.php?lang=en) is compiled in order to enable the comparison of the three main text classes of the written language: fiction, journalistic and scientific writing.

The corpus consists of journalistic texts, works of fiction and science texts. The Balanced Corpus of Estonian is a subpart or a subcorpus of the big Mixed Corpus of Estonian.
